### Stuff to do
- Add content to philosophy, CV, etc.
- Verify that links work
- Determine what kind of graphics/images you want to add (likely a pic of yourself?)
- Determine if SEO is a good thing to incorporate
- Come up with some blogs... Talk about the Python class? Talk about the Linux class? Talk about the journey to set this site up?
