With the help of a [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) Jekyll docs recommended, I was able to finally get my site up and running! 
My site part of the GitHub Pages environment and it is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Plus, I can use Markdown to author my content, which is then converted to HTML by Jekyll. :) 

When I get a chance, I start adding to this site to talk about what I'm learning (and maybe demo it too?).
