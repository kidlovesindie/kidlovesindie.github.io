Other than learning about Git and GitHub, I'm currently taking super-basic, intro courses about Python and Linux. 

# Learning about Python 
I'm auditing [Python for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) on Coursera, which is a specialization track for beginners to learn about the programming language. Dr. Charles "Chuck" Severance instructs the course, and he does it well! I'm super-engaged, and I think he explains Python, its syntax, and its concepts very well. 
I just completed the [first of five courses](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python) in the specialization, which focuses on installing Python, learning about synxtax and traceback errors, understanding control flow, creating basic programs from scratch, and running those programs from the command line.
Over the past few months, I didn't feel motivated to learn anything new--mainly because I developed a newfound love for gaming. But learning Python is a lot of fun. I find myself wanting to spend more time learning about it than playing games some nights.

## Python Progress
I completed auditing the first course in the Python for Everybody track today. I enrolled in the second course, [Python Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data). Dr. Chuck instructs the MOOC too, so I'm really pumped since I really enjoy his teaching style.

# Learning about Linux
Like most Millennials, I grew up using Windows OS. I transitioned to using the Mac OS in college when I bought my first laptop--a spring 2008 MacBook Pro--right before Freshman year kicked off. But I didn't know another operating system existed until a few years ago, which I think I can blame on the fact that I wasn't as technically savvy as I thought I was AND because I was your average tech consumer.
But the scales have fallen from my eyes (I guess you can say?) and I know about and understand the importance of Linux!

Anyways, to learn about Linux I'm auditing [Introduction to Linux](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+1T2020/course/) on edX.org. It is part of the Linux Foundation's curriculum. 
Unlike Dr. Chuck's Python for Everybody courses, Intro to Linux is primarily reading-centric with random demonstration videos thrown in the mix to showcase how to perform a task on one of the common Linux distros. As a result, the course isn't as fun to complete as Python for Everybody. 
Even though I'm not loving this kind of MOOC as much, I am having a lot of fun familiarizing myself with Ubuntu and Linux. I created a VM that runs Ubuntu on my wife's old 2009 MacBook Pro. I recognized it's not as intuitive for how to launch apps or how to install common packages (via the synaptic package manager). However, once I saw how to do both things via the MOOC, I don't feel as lost as I did when I was just poking around in the OS by myself.
What I really like about Linux is that it and all the apps that install with it (like LibreOffice) are open source projects. To me, open source projects evoke the intentionally free and communal spirit and continuous improvement ideals that make the Internet great. It also makes me want to contribute to open source projects somehwo, too... Perhaps I can find a product or project to add some content to?

## Linux Progress
I'm currently on Chapter 7, which focuses on command line operations. In order to completely audit the course, I have to tackle 11 more chapters. I'm really looking forward to learning more and more about Linux (and specifically Ubuntu) over the coming weeks...
