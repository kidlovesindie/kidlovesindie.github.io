	<h1>My Leadership Philosophy</h1>
	<p>My ultimate goal is support my folks to grow their skills, deepen their expertise, and drive their careers forward. I aim to gain trust through listening, collaborating, and following through on promises.</p>
	<p>We spend most of our waking hours at work. I want to create an environment where my writers can be their authentic selves, where they feel safe, seen, heard, and understood... and where they can be successful, creative, productive, and happy.</p>
        <p>I am against micromanaging, and I believe that writers thrive when given the chance to simply do what they do best: create content, research features, analyze information, and help users be successful.</p>  
	<p>In short, I’m here to support my folks when they face challenges, be a coach on their journey to grow into new roles and skills, and cheer on their successes and hard-earned wins. </p>
