	<p>I live in the land of breakfast tacos, craft beer, and live music: Austin, TX. I've lived in Austin ever since I attended UT to study English.</p>
	<p>About three years ago, I became a technical writer. I loved researching and writing about new and changing software technologies. I recently moved into a leadership role where I manage technical writers. Now, coaching and supporting my writers, helping them grow their skills and their confidence, and making them feel valued for their work and ideas are some of the most fulfilling parts of my job as a manager and leader.</p>
	<p>I love learning about open source software, Python, new technologies, and leadership skills and practices.</p>
	<p>When I'm not in work or learning mode, I play <a href="/videogames">video games</a>, binge TV shows, geek out with my wife, and cuddle with my grumpy old cat.</p>
