title: Caley's Adventures in Leading and Writing
---
<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Intro to Caley</h1>
	<p>I live in the land of breakfast tacos, craft beer, and live music: Austin, TX. I've lived in Austin ever since I attended UT to study English.</p>
	<p>About three years ago, I became a technical writer. I loved researching and writing about new and changing software technologies. I recently moved into a leadership role where I manage technical writers. I love coaching and supporting writers, helping them grow their skills and their confidence, and making them feel valued for their work and ideas.</p>
	<p>I love learning about open source software, Python, new technologies, and leadership skills and practices.</p>
	<p>When I'm not in work or learning mode, I love to play <a href="/games">video games</a>, binging TV shows, playing Scrabble with my wife, and cuddling with my grumpy cat.</p>
